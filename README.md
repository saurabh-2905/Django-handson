# Django (Web-app)

My very first attempt at learning Django when I had to work on web-development for an internship during one of the summer vacations during my masters. 

It is a basic prototype website that helps one to understands the basics of Django Framwork and MVC model in general.

For a more detailed explaination, one can refer to the tutorial series by one of my favourite youtubers, [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD0_1DPmfKM&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe9nqlirjacLkBYdgc2inh3&ab_channel=sentdex).
